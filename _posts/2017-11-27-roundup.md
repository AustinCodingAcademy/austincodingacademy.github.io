#### Speed mentoring is a super casual and fun way for people to meet others in their field and learn more about what’s needed to grow. We’ll have 3-4 sessions throughout the night and you can sign up to be in 1 or all 4. Each session is 30-45 minutes. We’ll guide & prompt you and in each session you’ll get to provide wisdom to multiple mentees. You feel good, they feel good. Win-win.
