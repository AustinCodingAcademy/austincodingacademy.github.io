Book Review of [Venture Deals](http://www.askthevc.com/) by Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson (Short Version)

When negotiating with investors for your startup, there are two main things you need to pay attention to: economics (the amount of money an investor will make from the sale of your company or in an IPO) and control (the investor's ability to veto certain decisions).

Have you considered the possible nightmare situation of raising some money from 30 different people and then having to chase them all down to do another round of financing or to sell the company?

If you are like most humans, you don't have a law, finance, and expert negotiator degree. So you have to find the most efficient way to learn specific topics as they come up. For some founders, raising money becomes one of these topics.

All founders should read Venture Deals as soon as the idea of 'raising money' comes into their minds.

[Brad Feld](http://www.foundrygroup.com/team/brad-feld/) and [Jason Mendelson](http://www.foundrygroup.com/team/jason-mendelson/) of [Foundry Group](http://www.foundrygroup.com/) have found a way to make terms like 'Redemption Rights' and 'No-shop Agreements' not only fun, but easy to understand.

They also don't waste any time. On page two they boil the term sheet down to those two important things mentioned above: economics and control.

The book also isn't just a long vocabulary lesson; it's packed with relevant information. For example, you want to make sure that your lawyer agrees to a modest fee cap before hiring her for an early round of fundraising.

### **"There are two main things startup founders need to pay attention to when negotiating with investors: economics and control."**


Along with law and finance advice, they dive into a specific mindset and formula to use when going about raising money. The authors explain that when they meet people who say they are "trying to raise money," "testing the waters," or "exploring different options," they are instantly turned off and smell uncertainty. Besides being completely decided on your choice to go with funding, you need to determine how much you are going to raise. The authors explain that while complex financial models are good to have, they much prefer you, as a founder, focused on a length of time you want to fund your company to get to the next meaning milestone. If you are brand new, how long will it take to get your first product shipped? How long until a specific number of users, or a specific amount of revenue?



From there you can assume no revenue growth. You can then determine your [burn rate](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/burnrate.asp) (monthly spending rate) by asking how many people it will take to get your product to that milestone. From there you know the length of your [runway](http://www.startupdefinition.com/runway) and how much money you need.

They also suggest that you should have a short description, an executive summary, and a Powerpoint presentation. You should focus on the content, and you get bonus points if you can give people a prototype to play with.

There are tons of other things these guys do an incredible job of breaking down into very easily digestible pieces. From sending your first contact email to getting ready for your IPO.

One of the hidden benefits of working with a coding school is that you will be exposed to people that not only understand these things, but know who to introduce you to when it's time to get these things ironed out.
