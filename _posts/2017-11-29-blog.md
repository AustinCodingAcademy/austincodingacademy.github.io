# Programming is hard. That’s precisely why you should learn it.

### Roger Collier on November 27 2017

## This week we want to share an important and interesting article about why you should learn how to code. It also explores personal development through challege, something our students are always striving toward.

### Roger Collier learned how to code as a hobby, something to counteract his consumption based lifestyle. He realized his downtime was mostly used consuming media, television, books, Twitter, Facebook etc. He channeled his desire to create and focused on learning to program. He found it difficult and time consuming but also incredibly rewarding.



#### "Learning something difficult, however, is beneficial in and of itself. The process is the prize. Struggling with code, while frustrating, is medicine for the mind.

#### "If you happen, along the way, to create something amazing and users flock to your app with open wallets, that’s great. If not, code anyway. If you master JavaScript and become a YouTube guru with more subscribers than the New York Times, that’s great. If not, code anyway.

#### "Many people learn programming to attain a specific goal. Perhaps your job is boring and you want a more challenging one. Nothing wrong with that. Maybe you want to break into tech because you need a higher income to support your family. Hey, someone has to buy the bagels and flip flops, and keep the WiFi pumping.

#### "*But you don’t need an endgame in mind to start your coding journey. Just begin. And if that journey becomes difficult, don’t despair. It means you’re on the right path. The hard one.*"
