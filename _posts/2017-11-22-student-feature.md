# Every week we like to feature one of our outstanding students at Austin Coding Academy. ACA’s student body is as diverse as it is interesting and we’d like to give ya’ll the opportunity to get to know them a little better. Our students make Austin Coding Academy the great place that it is.

## This week we’re putting the spotlight on Max Gaj a Northeast native living in South Austin! Max is learning to code through our new state of the art remote classrooms! We asked him to share a little about himself and his coding journey.

### *What is your hometown?*

#### Groton, Massachusetts


 
### *Where do you currently live?*

#### Oak Hill – Southwest Austin



 
### *What do you do for work now?*
 
#### I bartend on 6th Street

 
 
### *Tell us about what made you decide to change your future.*
 
#### As much as I enjoy the social aspect of bartending, I prefer the intellectual challenge that comes with coding. I started messing around with code on Codecademy and really liked it! Also, as I look toward the future, I know eventually I won’t want to be working until 3 or 4 in the morning. So if I weren’t to change industries now, I would be down the line anyway.
 
 
 
### *Why did you see coding as a tool of change?*
 
#### Every year more information is being put online. Coding provides a way to organize and make use of it all. Marketing and many other fields are vastly improved by the ability to collect and utilize data.
 
 
 
### *You’re taking our remote classes! Tell us about your experience!*
 
#### The remote classes are great! My teacher Erik does a great job of giving each student individual attention, making those of us online feel like we’re getting the same quality lessons. Taking {% if site.key != 'austin' '%} remote {% endif %} classes remotely saves me hours of commute time each week, hours that I can now use to study and become a stronger student.
 
 
 
### *What’s your dream job after completing the program?*
 
#### I would love to work for Google. They’re known for having an amazing work environment and are involved in so many facets of technology. They’re experts at using the data they collect to the fullest extent, for example their utilization of Google Maps to run self-driving cars.
 
 
 
### *What unique skill or experience do you have, tell us something that makes you – you.*
 
#### I love to cook! I studied culinary arts in high school, while working as a cook at the time too. I like to experiment with different styles of cooking from Italian to Indian, Tex-Mex of course, and more!
 
 
 
### *Since you’re learning remotely, what is your favorite place to code?*
 
#### I have an office space in my apartment that I’ve really come to make my own since starting at ACA.
 
 
 
### *Do you have any words of wisdom for incoming remote students?*

#### Reserve a place just for studying and taking lessons and remove and potential distractions from sight. It will make you much more productive!



### *What is your proudest moment related to learning to code?*

#### The first moment when I really shocked myself with how far I’d come in code was in the first semester when we were building a tic-tac-toe game in Javascript. We built artificial intelligence so that the computer would take a turn after the user. It was amazing to me to be able to create something so intricate.


### *Lastly, hit us with a joke*

#### I told my friend 10 jokes to get him to laugh. Sadly no pun in 10 did.
