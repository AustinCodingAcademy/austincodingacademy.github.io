# Every week we like to feature one of our outstanding students at Austin Coding Academy. ACA’s student body is as diverse as it is interesting and we’d like to give ya’ll the opportunity to get to know them a little better. Our students make Austin Coding Academy the great place that it is.

## This week we’re putting the spotlight on Renata Estes from Round Rock! We asked her to share a little about herself and her coding journey.

### What do you do for work now?

#### Contractor for Cognizant


### What got you interested in coding?

#### I found it difficult to find employment in the tech-booming city of Austin with an International Relations Degree. I had no technical skills and told myself, "Before I hop on a plane and try to get a job in Ecuador, I should check out one of these coding bootcamps...See what that's all about and if that can't help my situation here, I'll go to Ecuador."  I have already received solicitations to do little gigs here and there using the HTML and CSS skills I've developed so I might hold off on the flight for the time being. 


### How will you use your skills once you finish the courses?

#### I have become very interested in Front-End development, UX/UI design and Web Design. My plan is to continue to hone my skills in those areas and use the skills I already have to do some freelance web design on the side. I plan to do this until I'm comfortable enough to do that type of work full-time. 


### What's your passion project right now? Coding or otherwise.

#### My passion project is learning more about mobile app development. I'd like to launch a couple of apps in the next year or two that will help improve communities of color throughout Austin by putting the power and ability in the citizens' hands. 


### What unique skill or experience do you have?

#### I am a German-born, Texas-raised, Jamaican-American working to become fluent in Spanish. I believe this has led me to be more open and receptive when I meet people, more open to their stories and their backgrounds. If people cannot readily identify me based on a hunch or assumptions, I know I can't do that either. 


### What do you appreciate the most about your whole ACA experience?

#### I appreciate the number of the coding {% if site.key != 'austin' '%} remote {% endif %} classes led by women. Whether it's as the main instructor or a teaching assistant, it has made me want to step my game up. I have enjoyed seeing women lead the coursework and being very knowledgeable about the subject. 


### What is your proudest moment related to learning to code?

#### My proudest moment has been using my skills to update some elements of my church's website. Of course, I'm still learning as I go, but now my church turns to me for help. That's awesome considering I didn't even know what HTML and CSS meant just a couple months ago and now I'm using it on their site.


### Would you rather do battle with one horse-sized duck or 100 duck-sized horses?

#### Good question! If by battle you mean dance battle, it would be with one horse-sized duck. 100 duck-sized horses is a lot of competition and I'm not sure we'd all fit on the dance floor.
