#### Since its founding in 2014, Austin Coding Academy (ACA) has had the privilege to help hundreds of individuals switch into a promising career in tech through our highly-accessible, part-time coding schools. We’ve held our courses at several locations in Central and East Austin, and are now excited to announce our second Austin location - our fifth location overall - opening June 19th at [Tech Ranch](https://techranchaustin.com) in North Austin.

#### We will continue to offer our full stack JavaScript courses out of downtown [Capital Factory](https://capitalfactory.com/), Austin’s “center of gravity for entrepreneurship,” where we’ve been grateful to live for nearly the last year. We look forward to serving North Austinites and the large technology companies in the area.

#### We’re also excited to say that the **North Austin campus will teach [C# and .NET](https://www.thesoftwareguild.com/blog/reasons-to-learn-c-sharp/)**. Experience with these legacy languages will allow our students to stand out to larger corporations who maintain established code bases. ACA is the first coding school in Austin to teach C# and .NET.

## Why we do what we do:

#### [With thousands of full-stack developer positions open in Austin](https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=Full+Stack+Developer&l=Austin%2C+TX), we’re proud to be the only homegrown coding school in town, and the only school to focus exclusively on the part-time, adult learner. Austin Coding Academy was founded on the principle that students shouldn’t need to quit their jobs to learn to code, and that learning opportunities should be affordable. With that mission in mind, our tuition for the full course comes in at around half of full-time immersion schools. Additionally, because our classes are in the evening, our instructors are able to work their full-time developer jobs during the day. This way, our instructors remain on top of the most cutting-edge technology in the developer world, and serve as great role models to our developing students.

## Our expansion:

#### ACA has been expanding rapidly throughout Texas, with [San Antonio Coding Academy](http://sanantoniocodingacademy.com), [Houston Coding Academy](http://houstontxcodingacademy.com) and [Dallas Coding Academy](http://dallascodingacademy.com) successfully launched over the last year. The addition of a campus at Tech Ranch solidifies our place in Austin’s local technology scene, as it serves as the northern hub for entrepreneurship. For example, Tech Ranch recently launched their [Incubator for Innovation and Impact in partnership with Concordia University](http://www.builtinaustin.com/2017/03/03/concordia-university-opens-incubator-tech-ranch) and provides several [startup accelerator tracks](https://techranchaustin.com/programs/), to which we hope to expose our students.  As Austin’s only homegrown coding academy, we’re excited to be able to serve more areas of the Austin community.

## Come hang out with us!

#### We invite you to come check out our new space at our [Open House Mon. June 5th](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/austin-coding-academy-open-house-tickets-34369733799) where you can meet our grads, enjoy refreshments, and tour the new campus.

### Tech Ranch
ACA has been expanding rapidly throughout Texas, with San Antonio Coding Academy, Houston Coding Academy and Dallas Coding Academy having been launched over the last year. With their downtown campus located at Capital Factory, Austin’s downtown center of gravity for entrepreneurship, the addition of a campus at Tech Ranch solidifies their place in the local startup scene. Tech Ranch, a northern hub for entrepreneurship, recently launched their Incubator for Innovation and Impact in partnership with Concordia University.


### Why the new digs?
Austin Coding Academy offers a full stack coding education that brings students from beginner to developer over the course of 9 months of part time classes, and caters the content of their curriculum to the job market of each location. Their downtown campus teaches a JavaScript stack, while other campuses outside of Austin teach a C#/.NET stack. The North Austin campus will follow suit with Houston, Dallas, and San Antonio in order to increase the class offerings available to Austin students. From CEO, Chris Helmueller “Because of the continued increase in demand for our program – we’ve seen record enrollments each quarter since we started – we’ve found the need to expand our presence and offerings to meet the needs of people looking to transition into tech.”


### ACA's Growing Roots
ACA was founded in 2014 as an answer to the immersive coding boot camp movement, offering classes in the evening designed to bring people to proficiency without having to quit their day jobs. Because their classes are in the evenings, the instructors are full time developers, ideal role models for students looking to transition into the tech industry. Leveraging these instructors alongside their unique Socratic style curriculum, a focus on the working adult learner, and practical schedule allows ACA to offer a full service coding education to transform the lives of people looking to move into tech. It was founded on the principle of making coding education accessible and affordable, with tuition typically half that of their full time boot camp competitors. Considering the boom in 2016 of coding schools moving to Austin, ACA is proud to be the only locally grown coding school in town, with other schools hailing from large, out of state education companies like Kaplan (Dev Bootcamp), the Apollo Education Group (The Iron Yard), and Trilogy Education Services (UT Bootcamp). ACA was nominated one of the 11 Best Coding Bootcamps in the South by coursereport.com -->
