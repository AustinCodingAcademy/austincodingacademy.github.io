Internet browsing has come a long way and it's gotten smarter and more user friendly. Browsers have improved your user experience by remembering when you visit pages, what your language preference is, they can even tailor advertisements you see online to be more relevant to your specific interests. If you've ever wondered how this is possible, the answer is simply cookies. The internet is full of them, like a bottomless jar of gooey chocolate deliciousness.
Before you start craving your laptop, let's explore what cookies are.

### **What Are Cookies?**


First of all, they are not edible, but I'm sure you've already figured that out!
They are small text files stored on your computer's browser. Cookies are created whenever you use your browser to visit a website that uses them.
They are mainly used to anonymously collect information about you such as age, location and interests. They do not collect personal information such as photos, contacts, bank info and personal data. They also don't hang around forever; some are deleted automatically when you close your browser, others expire after a period of inactivity.



### **Types of Cookies**


Not all cookies are created equal, therefore they don't all perform the same functions.
[Revissio](http://www.revissio.com), a company dedicated to protecting your private data when online shopping, has broken down the different kinds of cookies and their functions brilliantly. Here's a direct quote from their article: [Online Cookies. All You Need To Know](http://www.revissio.com/online-cookies-all-you-need-to-know/)



> "People frequently ask how long cookies are saved on the computer. The truth is that it depends on the type of cookie. There are two types:

> - **Session cookies** are maintained only for the duration of one browser session. They can be used for several helpful functions, such as remembering what you put into your shopping basket while browsing a site, for security purposes when you are using your bank's website, or to facilitate use of webmail.
> - **Persistent cookies** are stored between browser sessions, allowing your preferences and choices to be remembered the next time you visit the same site, and potentially facilitating targeted advertising.
>

>
> Another question that is commonly raised is where cookies originate. Again, the answer is that it depends on the type of cookie, since cookies come from different sources:



> - **First-party** are set by the website that you are currently visiting.
> - **Third-party** are set by another domain; they are not set by the site that you are currently visiting.
>

>
> This distinction also means that cookies can perform a variety of different functions, partly depending on where they come from:



> - **Strictly necessary cookies** provide capabilities crucial to a good user experience, such as remembering your earlier actions when you navigate back to a page, or passing security tokens to different areas of a website to identify that you are logged in.
> - **Performance cookies** help website operators improve the user experience on the site by collecting data for web analytics, monitoring ad response rates, affiliate tracking, improving error management and testing variations of design.
> - **Functionality cookies** are, typically, the result of an action that you conducted on the site, and are sometimes used to remember your preferences, offer you a service, or prevent you from being offered something that you previously rejected.
> - **Targeting cookies** can be used by advertising networks to collect information about your browsing habits or measure the effectiveness of a particular marketing campaign. The privacy statements on sites that have these types of cookies should indicate that the cookie is being used as part of an advertising network."

### **How To Manage Them**


Cookies have made browsing the internet simpler and more complicated simultaneously.
Simpler because they can remember how you like things set up, if you like to stay signed in and such.
More complicated because most of us don't know much about them therefore we don't know how to manage them.



One way to find out who is adding cookies is using the [free Ghostery Browser Extension](https://www.ghostery.com/our-solutions/ghostery-browser-extension/) to control how you are tracked online. You can see which websites are adding third-party cookies, what they do and you can choose the ones you want and which you'd like to turn off.

Another way to manage cookies is with the Settings option in your browser.
