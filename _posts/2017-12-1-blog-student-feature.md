# Every week we like to feature one of our outstanding students at Austin Coding Academy. ACA’s student body is as diverse as it is interesting and we’d like to give ya’ll the opportunity to get to know them a little better. Our students make Austin Coding Academy the great place that it is.

## This week we’re putting the spotlight on Erika Ortiz from El Paso, Texas or as she says 'Chuco Town to locals'! We asked her to share a little about herself and her coding journey.

### *Where do you currently reside?*

#### I’m living in the Mueller area, sort of. I think you can barely call it the Mueller area, but I’m still claiming it.


### *What sparked your interested in coding?*

#### Austin obviously has a huge tech presence that I wanted to tap into but wasn’t sure how. It started with me wanting to learn the language enough to have a conversation, but one thing led to another and I found myself at Austin Coding Academy.


### *What's your goal once you finish the courses?*

#### I want to take what I’ve learned and apply to the Latina entrepreneurs I’ve been working with this past year and a half. Technology has the power to help people live less stressed, more joyful lives but sometimes technology isn’t designed with every user in mind, expecially those on this platform. I’m eager to shrink that gap.
 
 
### *What's your passion project right now? Coding or otherwise.*

#### I’m working with a Microfinance startup called JUST. We’re working with these Latina entrepreneurs through capital, community, and financial coaching. We’re starting to test the benefits between financial health and physical health, which is extremely exciting! We’re also talking about bringing behavioral incentives onto our platform. I’m fortunate to have a job that has developed into my passion that continues to develop these passion projects.
 
 
### *Do you have any unique skills or experiences?*

#### This year I started to dabble with User Design and Research, and I have loved it! I really do think it’s important to design and develop with the user in mind, so I’m happy to have been exposed to the experience and plan on developing that skill further.   
 
 
### *Where is your favorite spot to vacation?*
 
#### My family loves taking trips to Las Vegas ever since I was little. You’d be surprised how many arcades there are for kids. So it’s remained a favorite spot for me. We actually went for Thanksgiving; we’re a crazy / fun family.
 
 
### *Has there been anything that has caught you off guard since starting class? The schedule? Difficulty of learning? Something you weren't expecting?*

#### I pretty much expected it to be difficult, considering I had little to no experience. It has been a challenge juggling work life with homework life.. I’m sticking with it, though!
 
 
### *Be honest, tell us about a hurdle you faced while in class and how you overcame it.*

#### So we started learning React before Thanksgiving, which pretty much overwhelmed me like no other. We were advised to keep practicing with the promise that one day it would click, so that’s what I’ve been doing. I’m trusting the process and waiting patiently for it to click


### *Where is your favorite place to code?*

#### I’m a huge fan of Bennu on Riverside and South Congress. It used to be Dominican Jos, but it still has a great setting with many extension cords!


### *What is your favorite thing you've programmed so far?*

#### We’ve been coding a few games like Checkers and Towers of Hanoi.


### *If you're not studying or in school, what are you likely doing?*
 
#### Besides working, I’m probably packing my bags to travel somewhere. I’ve recently gotten the travel bug and have been on the road a lot. My roommate and I have savings set aside for a few trips; we’re just waiting for Hopper to let us know when the price has dropped enough. Spain, Brazil, and Austria are our top priorities.
 
 
### *Let's go with an old classic, You're stranded on a desert island and you can only have 3 items. What would you have?*
 
#### A first aid kit, water, and Chuck Norris of course!
