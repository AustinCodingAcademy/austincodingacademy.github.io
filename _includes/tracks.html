              Some are looking to join a large and established organization, others are looking to jump in with a hot new startup, and
              still others are simply looking to pick up a new skill to add to their freelance arsenal. Regardless of where
              youâ€™re going, we have a track that guides you along that path.
            </p>
            <p class="text-left">
              All tracks start with the Intro course, a class designed to give a strong set of fundamentals and actionable tools that are
              valuable regardless of where your path leads. From there students choose their path with the Intermediate level:
              Full Stack JavaScript, Full Stack, C#/.NET, or Web Design.

              This track is for people who want to build apps and get a job as a developer. The frameworks we teach in this track lend
              themselves to companies that support more open source technologies, and these companies tend to be a bit newer,
              though this is not a rule.

              Similar to the Full Stack JS track, this track is also for people who want to build apps and get a job as a developer. The
              main difference is that this track focuses on the C#/.NET stack, which typically lends itself to larger, more
              established companies, though again, this is not a rule.

              This track is for people who want to design beautiful web experiences and get a job as a UX/UI designer or a freelance web
              designer. Students learn both design and web development skills as well as the capabilities to launch their
              own freelance business.
