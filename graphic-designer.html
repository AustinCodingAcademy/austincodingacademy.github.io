          Today, every company is a tech company, and if they're not already, soon everyone will be working in tech in some form or another.
          <br>
          <br>
          Designers are no different. Whether working in a large agency or completing the latest freelance contract, designers are frequently interacting with developers and staying up to date on the newest technologies.
          <br>
          <br>
          To keep up with clients' needs, the developer/designer hybrid (see also: a unicorn) has become as invaluable part of any team.

          Have your designs executed exactly the way you want them - By understanding how web development works, you'll be able to design wireframes that don't need to be "touched up" by the developer.
          <br>
          <br>
          Save time; code your own designs - When the distance between designer and developer is zero, the time to project completion is significantly dimished.
          <br>
          <br>
          Raise you value - Freelance or corporate, startup, or agency, no matter where you work, being able to design and code makes for a valuable pair of assets.
