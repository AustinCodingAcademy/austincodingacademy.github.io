Christopher Sica and Luke Filipos awkwardly try to find their radio voices while describing why they think it's so important for people to learn how to code.

The interesting thing to note is that when Austin Coding Academy started, the focus was on working with entrepreneurs to help them control costs with development teams.

Over time, the market proved that a lot of people form Austin were stuck in jobs and careers that didn't have the creativity or challenge that they needed.

More and more employees of major Austin employers started coming to Austin Coding Academy to grow their existing careers: Graphic Designers started learning HTML and CSS so they could provide better wireframes to the development team. Marketing managers and marketing team members started learning HTML structure to increase their SEO skill set and out-of-the-box optimization toolbox. The list goes on and so does the most affordable and accessible coding education in Texas. Learn to code and enjoy the video!
