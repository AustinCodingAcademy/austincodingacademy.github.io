        <h1>Student Grievance Policy</h1>
        <p>
          It is the school's policy to resolve student grievances by working
          directly with the student, instructor, and other students if affected.
          Students with grievances should initially contact their instructor and
          articulate their grievance in writing. The instructor will notify the
          Director of Academics of student grievance and attempt to resolve the
          grievance. Attempts to resolve the grievance will be documented in
          email by the instructor and copied to the Director of Academics. If
          the instructor and student are unable to resolve the grievance, the
          grievance will be escalated to the Director of Academics. The Director
          of Academics will review prior resolution documentation, identify
          student concerns, needs, desires, and attempt to resolve the grievance
          with the student. The Director of Academics will document this process
          in writing in a student report file. If the Director of Academics is
          unable to resolve the student grievance, the Director of Academics
          will convene a committee of 2 student peers, 2 other certified
          instructors, and the Director of Academics to resolve the student
          grievance. The committee will review articulated grievance and
          documented attempts to resolve and form a majority decision for
          grievance resolution and present to student for approval. The Director
          of Academics will document their resolution in the student report file.
