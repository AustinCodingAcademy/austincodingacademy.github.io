Happy Merry Chrismakwanzika! At ACA we're getting ready to put a close to 2016, with our 8th session graduating in December, and spark up what is looking to be an absolutely incredible 2017. With the turning of the year, we have a couple important announcements to make.

Our goal at ACA is and has always been to provide accessible, affordable coding education. We don't think you need to quit your job to learn to code. We don't think you need to put your whole life on hold and cram an education into three months. We believe in a sustainable, healthy learning process that produces solid fundamentals, strong technical understanding, the ability to work in a team, and how to learn other languages and frameworks efficiently. At ACA we don't just teach people how to code, we teach people how to build themselves into productive members of the tech community.

In order to continue this mission and bring it to new levels we have a few important announcements:

- As a commitment to our current students, **tuition for those who are already enrolled or who have already applied will remain the same for the duration of their tenure at ACA.** Effectively, they will be grandfathered in at the original tuition.
- What will this money be used for?

  - Expanded offerings in career services and staff
  - More dedicated space for students
  - Overall improvement of technical resources



- How was this price determined?

  - We strive to have the most affordable classes possible and have kept prices the same for almost two years. While it is impossible to keep the same price forever, we want to make sure that this increase doesn't exclude people who would currently be able to attend otherwise. With that in mind we have elected to peg our tuition at 6% of the mean household income for the city of Austin.
  - According to the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_12420.htm#00-0000) the Austin area annual mean wage is $49, 560.
  - We will revisit this figure at the end of each year to establish tuition prices for the following year. We hope this will be seen as a healthy way to allow tuition to grow with the economy, while still maintaining affordability for students.
