There's a well-documented deficiency of women in tech fields, one that is long lasting and becoming more pronounced as we move towards a more digital society.

As we examine the pipeline that places people into the tech fields, we look at the demographics of children and adolescents who decide to learn to code, and ask ourselves, "do we need more women in tech?".



The gender gap in tech starts long before the hiring process. For some reason, school aged boys are entering higher education with an eye on learning to code (if they haven't already learned), while girls just aren't at the same rate.

### Is This a Bad Thing?


So what if young girls just aren't as interested in coding and computer science as boys? You don't see a large-scale effort to push men into traditionally female-dominated sectors, like K-12 education.



It's a valid point; aspects of childhood simply condition gendered occupations, but in this case, there's a small problem with that line of thinking:

### Girls _Are_ Interested in Computers at a Young Age


A group that promotes female participation in tech fields reports that [74 percent](http://techcrunch.com/2016/05/10/the-lack-of-women-in-tech-is-more-than-a-pipeline-problem/) of young girls show an interest in STEM fields like computer science, yet a much smaller portion actually pursue them in higher education. Many of the women that do enter the tech industry, don't do it to train as software developers, but rather in positions that one source calls ["tech-adjacent"](https://www.themuse.com/advice/why-we-need-to-rethink-women-in-tech).



This means that the gender gap between men and women that actually learn to code is larger than the gap between men and women in the tech field, an even more puzzling phenomenon.

According to the New York Times, girls' enrollment into computer science courses [is dropping](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/01/opinion/sunday/how-to-get-girls-into-coding.html?_r=0), and in many cases, girls don't look at the tech sector as a career possibility, primarily due to the fact that culture of the field is dominated by males.

### So What?


So women don't learn to code, is that really a problem? Would more women really change the culture of software engineering, a sector that relies on solitary, individual work?



In actuality, yes. A [study found](http://www.recode.net/2016/6/2/11834380/craig-newmark-women-tech-funding-gender-gap-diversity) that concerning funding for start-up tech companies that start-ups run by women provide an average of 35 percent higher return on investment when funded. This means that some of our best and brightest minds come from a population who don't even learn the building blocks as early as their male counterparts.

### Can We Find a Solution to Have More Women in Tech?


More than simply being efficient with investments, diversity is a positive aspect in any sector. Whether the outcome remains the same in terms of the gender gap in tech, girls need to be encouraged to learn to code at young age.



The computer science industry is a lucrative combination of fast-growing and high paying, and an increase in women in tech is just the shot in the arm that the sector needs to sustain quality as it grows.

Luckily, there are options for girls to learn to code, now more than ever. Specialized schools like the [Austin Coding Academy](//www.austincodingacademy.com/what-we-stand-for/) are popping up all over the country, providing affordable and multi-faceted options for girls and women to enter a traditionally male-dominated field.
