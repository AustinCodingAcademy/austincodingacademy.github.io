### Monday, December 4th 5:30pm-6:30pm

### Capital Factory - 1st Floor Wall-E

## [Keywords: Get your résumé past keyword filters](https://www.meetup.com/Austin-Job-Seekers/events/245287746/)
 
#### If you have ever sent out your résumé a hundred times and not gotten any hits, you're not alone. And if you've heard anything about ATS software (applicant tracking software), it's that employers will filter out candidates based on the words that they use in their résumé. This session seeks to decode keywords and show attendees how they can "get past the robot" and into the hands of the real decision makers.
