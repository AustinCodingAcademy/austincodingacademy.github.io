          Remember, you are free to obtain a loan from any lender, not just
          those listed below. Loans must be repaid with interest, and taking
          out a loan is a big decision, so consider it carefully. If you
          choose to pursue financing, we encourage you to explore all your
          options fully before working with any particular lender. While these
          loan programs may be available to you, there is no agreement in
          place between {{ site.city }} Coding Academy and these organizations.
