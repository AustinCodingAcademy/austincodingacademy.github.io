# Every week we like to feature one of our outstanding students at Austin Coding Academy. ACA’s student body is as diverse as it is interesting and we’d like to give ya’ll the opportunity to get to know them a little better. Our students make Austin Coding Academy the great place that it is.

## This week we’re putting the spotlight on Taylor Bently from Kyle, Texas! We asked her to share a little about herself and her coding journey.

### *What sparked your interested in coding?*

#### Technology is fascinating and always changing. I love learning, and wanted a challenge! 



### *What's your goal once you finish the courses?* 

#### I hope to be a freelance developer! I love traveling. My goal is to be able to work as I explore new parts of the world. 



### *Has there been anything that has caught you off guard since starting class, something you maybe weren't expecting?*

#### It is definitely a challenge! What I was most surprised by, is how similar this experience has been to my learning German. While I knew I was learning a programming language, I didn't anticipate that the learning process would mirror a natural language. 



### *What's your passion project right now? Coding or otherwise.*

#### I'm currently recording music with my band, Lady Morgan. Music is my first love. 



### *What unique skill or experience do you have?*

#### I teach yoga and train Brazilian Jiu Jitsu! 



### *Where is your favorite place to code?*

#### Austin Bouldering Project is my favorite. It's nice to take a quick climbing or yoga break to clear my thoughts.  



### *If you're not studying or in school, what are you likely doing?*

#### You could find me traveling, eating, enjoying the beautiful outdoors. I also enjoy being physically active! 



### *You're a new addition to the crayon box, what color would you be and why?*

#### Can I be the absence of color, #000000? I'm detail oriented and well-balanced, not just in the yoga sense. Black accentuates the colors which surround it, and I always hope to brighten the lives of those around me.
