  - question: Do I have to take the Intro course to get into the Intermediate etc?
    answer: >
      Students with a pre-qualified level of proficiency can test into the
      intermediate and advanced courses.

    answer: >
      Students can take classes at their own pace, however we do encourage
      taking classes consecutively one after the other, as the continuity in
      education and practice is paramount; as with learning a spoken language,
      if you don't use it you lose it.

  - question: What kind of computer do I need?
    answer: >
      Just about any Mac or Windows laptop built within the last five or
      six years will do. If you have a choice, we recommend a Mac, but there's no
      need to buy a mac if you have a functional Windows machine. We do discourage
      Chromebooks and Tablets.
