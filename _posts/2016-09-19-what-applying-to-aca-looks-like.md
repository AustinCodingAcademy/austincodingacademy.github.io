I must admit, applying to Austin Coding Academy after stumbling across it, was kind of exciting. You see, I had already suffered the sticker shock of various coding bootcamps and schools. And, might I add, my google skills are on point. But ACA's google search presence wasn't there when I searched four months ago.

After entering my wants and needs of a coding school into a "Find My Bootcamp" website I stumble upon, ACA popped up at the top of the list.



### **Here are my priorities, whittled down to three important deal breakers:**





**1) Schedule:**
Working two jobs, one with zero scheduling flexibility, I only had a small window to take classes. And if the schedule didn't fit, it wasn't gonna happen.

**2) Price:**
I'm on a budget. It has to be reasonably price and $8,000 plus is not reasonable in my case. However after looking around for a couple of weeks all I was finding was eight, ten, to $12,000 schools. Finding a school I consider financially with in reach without having to take out a loan (which was often pushed by some school) seemed bleak.

**3) How I'll learn:**
I'm a pretty social person and a philomath to the core. I learn by comity, conversations and doing. This was a big reason why I loved college so much (minus the soul crushing debt. Le sigh). I got to bounce ideas off of others and talk about the abstract and keep my brain entertained. I am not an "online learner." I learn best in a classroom setting. And that is what I was looking for. A brick and mortar classroom.


It turned out ACA checked all my boxes. So like I said, I was very excited. However, as it always is with starting, or attempting to start (or in my case simply thinking of attempting to start) something new, I had my trepidations.



What really was I to expect? Not just in the class but afterward? What is the future gonna look like if I go down this path? Does committing to this really put me in a place I want to be?

All the questions for all the feels. I slept on it for about a week, which was both good and bad. Timing after all is a bitch.

### Applying for ACA





Realizing that none of my questions would really be answered unless I actually tried, I clicked the 'Apply Now' button (top right hand corner, hint hint).

Filling out the questionnaire, I never really thought twice about the word 'apply.' Half the questions on the 2016 questionnaire are demographic and general information questions: Name, location, class you're applying for, city of the school you're applying for etc. The other half takes a little more thought: your experience with coding, why you want to learn to code and my favorite, 'link the meme that best describes you.'

Mine?

### What to expect after clicking submit





Once I had everything filled in I clicked "Submit." This is where the 'apply' word comes in. I received a confirmation email which prompted me to schedule a time that would be best for a phone interview in the near future. It dawned on me that I was applying to be accepted (yeah it's obvious now). It has been about 10 years since I had to actually be considered and accepted first before I paid for something. I forgot that being considered for anything takes time and as of my 'submit' moment classes would start in less than 5 working days. Uh-oh.

I received another confirmation email after scheduling my phone interview which detailed how to prepare for it. The last sentence also laid out that it would take about 2 weeks from assignment submission date to get word of being accepted. Eeeep! Yeah, I panicked a little bit. However there was this handy email for questions so I wrote to it:

Dear handy email,

> _"So, I just got finished scheduling my phone interview. I received the "How to prepare for your ACA phone interview" email and once I read it, I realized it would take a lot longer to get accepted than I thought._

> _I wanted to attend the session starting July 25th. Is it possible after completing the requirements in a timely manner, to get accepted in time for this session? I did not see a "deadline to apply" date for this session on the website, so I'm hoping to get in on time. "_


_(Notice my "subtle" passive aggressive tone of you-didn't-put-a-deadline-how-was-I-to-know type of panic in the sentence, yet still trying come off as not annoyed.)_ I hit send. To my surprise I got a quick reply.



> _"You certainly can finish the application process in time to begin on July 25th._

> _If you would prefer to move your phone interview to an earlier date, you can use the link you used to schedule the first time, or I can help you with that._
> _Let us know how we can help you."_


OK. I feel better now, I thought. I moved my phone interview to the next day and eagerly awaited the call.



### The Interview





The interview was pleasant, to the point and brief; about 10 minutes.

I was asked questions like:

- What are you looking to get out of class?

- What are your goals?

- Weather I was just looking to try out coding for a little bit or hoping to make a full career transition?


He also set my expectations for the class (the Intro class for me):



- **Time commitment:** "_It would be about 5 hours of in class time a week, plus time spent on homework, projects and practice outside the classroom, about 9-10 hours a week."_ To me this wasn't unreasonable. Any new practice takes time and dedication in order to level up in life.

- **Instructor engagement:** "_Don't be shy, use your time with the instructors. They are there to help and teach so speaking up and asking questions is important."_ This one for me I understood but have never had any problems with. I'm that nerd at the front of the class constantly raising their hand (though staying on topic with questions relevant to the whole class). But I understand it's an issue when the class mirrors the "Voodoo Economics" Scene from [Ferris Bueller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhiCFdWeQfA).


- **Open Communication:** "_Let them know when you are having trouble with something. Whether it be a topic you're struggling with, not really getting the instructor's style of teaching, etc. The door is open for feedback."_ Ah, I can see myself struggling with this one. When it comes to not grasping something I will definitely raise and ask again in class. But especially outside of class, I like to sit and problem solve and try to work it out on my own, sans-help. But I've made a mental note to readjust and adapt.



I just got finished talking to someone about how important it is to set expectations so everyone is on the same page. Weather it be for clients, or students, employers and or co-workers. So I really appreciated the setting of the expectations above.



### The next step





Before the interview concluded he explained the email I would get shortly after. It was the next sept in the application process, I was not done yet.

The assignment contained in the email was to write an essay from a prompt they provided and to explain a few lines of python code. Python was something I had only heard about and immediately had to google--which was encouraged.

Normally, my interviewer said it takes prospective students a week to complete. So with my limited time line, I really only had two days to get this done before the weekend and Day 1 of class.

Though overall the assignments were not the most taxing, being assigned something pushed me into a "school-like" head space I hadn't been in a while. Which prepared me for the days to come.
