### The Assignment


I chose one of the two prompts and began to ponder. "What is an important truth you believe that very few people agree with you on?" It took me a while to digest this and mull it over. Were there any real truths about myself? What is a substantial truth, really? I like corndogs. That's a truth. They're not substantial, but are delicious.


Keeping the prompt open,  I scrolled through Facebook rolling my eyes when I came across a post with a long arguing comment section. I scrolled past and scoffed at the share of a very biased political piece that was in one direction and laughed that under it was another shared biased piece of the opposite persuasion. Immediately over-it, I was relieved by the copious amount of dog and baby pictures because Facebook knows I literally like those the most often.


Then DING! I had my fished out idea for the essay. I worked on it for about 3 hours then took another hour to edit it (looking at it now I've seen some things I missed). You can read it here in the accompanying blog post called "An example of an ACA Application Essay."


Once I finished the essay I dug into the python code. ACA recommended we use any "resources online you feel would be helpful to you (Wikipedia, Stackoverflow, Codecademy, etc.)." So I did. I hadn't ever really seen the python coding language before, but after a couple of minutes reading about it, it could take an educated guess at "decoding it" ie: putting the code in my own words. Took me another hour, but I also am the not the fastest worker. I think about things too much.

All and all the assignment took about five-ish hours. Now all I had to do was wait and I didn't have to wait long.

### Getting Accepted  


As you've probably guess I got accepted into Austin Coding Academy. I was worried about dealing with such a quick acceptance/turnaround time. But they got back to me the next day in the afternoon and it was official.



I showed up for class that following Monday the most excited to learn. The week-before decision making process and quick turnaround of the assignments had unknowingly help prepare me for the time management I would be going through for the rest of session.

But that's another blog for another day.
