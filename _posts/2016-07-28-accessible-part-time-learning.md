<span style="font-weight: 400;">Are you ready to learn something new? Tired of your job? Yearning for a change? Bored or unsatisfied? You're not alone. According to a 2014 report by New-York based research group The Conference Board, 52.3% of Americans are unhappy at work.  Austin Coding Academy believes these things can be solved with Part Time Classes offered in the evenings.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, why do you feel like you're stuck? The answer is ‘engagement'. According to psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, how involved you are in an activity, and whether it challenges your knowledge and provides you fulfillment is directly connected to your happiness. In short,

<span style="font-weight: 400;">learning makes you happy

<span style="font-weight: 400;">.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe you're looking for a challenge, to further your career, or to quench your thirst for knowledge - no matter the reason, part time classes help you to

<span style="font-weight: 400;">achieve your goals and feel rewarded.



# There's always time to learn.





<span style="font-weight: 400;">You want to make a change, to learn a new skill - sounds great! But do you have the time to commit to school, homework and assignments?

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer is yes

<span style="font-weight: 400;"> - and you'll be surprised how simple it can be.

Lets face it, life is a delicate balancing act. Every day, we make decisions on where we spend our finite amount of energy, based on our personal priorities. Work, friends, hobbies, and even the mundane things like grocery shopping - they all take time, effort and mental motivation. Just keeping up can be exhausting!

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Adding another activity to your busy schedule can seem intimidating -

<span style="font-weight: 400;">but it doesn't have to be

<span style="font-weight: 400;">. Part-time classes are surprisingly easy to fit into your schedule.

# So, why part time?





While being a full time student can be great, not everyone can put their life on hold to study - and not everyone wants to. Full time college is daunting - it's expensive, exhausting, and definitely takes up all your time.

Between paying tuition and struggling to find and keep a job, schools have realized that education is changing. Studying full time is not the only way to learn, and part time students are often more motivated and dedicated. Best of all, you don't need to sacrifice your life for your education!

# Balance is the key.





Part time courses can allow you to work a full-time job, run a business, care for your family and see your friends while still having time to learn. With so many courses out there, it's important to consider your choices - what are you passionate about, and what gives you the best opportunities to grow?

Coding is a great skill to have - it opens doors in surprising places. Ever wanted to start your own business as a web developer? Better understand product development in your existing career? Become an UX aficionado? Being able to code doesn't just mean building pretty websites. It's an opportunity to maximise your chance for success.

With Austin Coding Academy's range of part time coding classes and flexible schedules, you can tailor your learning experience to mesh seamlessly with your existing commitments! In as little as six hours per week, ACA can help you to quickly learn coding languages starting with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. You'll learn to build apps with Javascript and jQuery, advancing to full stack programming abilities.

At ACA, you'll learn coding skills while experiencing a small class size, bi-weekly classes with an optional weekend lab for projects and questions. You'll have the ability to work one-on-one with teachers, and they're also available to support you online whenever you need it.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether it's for a change of career, a new skill, or to further your existing knowledge,

<span style="font-weight: 400;">part time classes at Austin Coding Academy are the help you need to make a change

<span style="font-weight: 400;">.
