          Classes Designed to Move at the Pace of Life
        </h3>
        <p>
          Our tracks are broken up into 3 course levels. These classes are
          designed to get you from beginner to job ready in a sustainable and accessible
          manner, without having to quit your job or mortgage your future.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each one of these courses is a 10 week session that meets twice a week in the evenings. These tracks are comprehensive and
          every class will have homework, projects, and assessments to ensure comprehension, however you wonâ€™t be on your
          own. We maintain a strict 10:1 student to teacher ratio, plenty of one-on-one time and office hours with instructors,
          as well as a vibrant online community of current students and alumni that are all engaged in helping each other
          succeed.

                Throughout the three levels students are invited to participate in various career services events, from resume and interview
                workshops to field trips and networking events at local tech companies. Once done with their program, students
                begin searching for and applying to top organizations.
