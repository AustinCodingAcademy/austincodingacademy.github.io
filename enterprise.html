            the best in your younger developers by exposing them to an
            advanced education in your technology stack.

          <small>
            The best managers are the ones who understand their teams and
            their products the best. Understanding the development process is
            an invaluable trait and its effects are often seen in improved
            intra-team communication and boosted sales.

          Tailor Fit, Not Off the Rack
          <br />
          <small>
            Up to date, custom built curricula, that fit your team. Not "one
            size fits all" classes from 2002. Your customized training program
            covers the skills your team needs and not the ones it doesn't.
            Making sure the training program we build fits your situation is
            what we're all about.

          Cutting Edge Information

          <small>
            Technology changes and your team evolves with that change. What was
            bleeding edge five years ago, might be legacy today. For this reason
            every training program is made "to order", so when our instructors
            build your curriculum, it's with the latest, most up to date
            research, not a pre-packaged course deployed to every client.

            multi-month continuing education and enrichment projects, we build
