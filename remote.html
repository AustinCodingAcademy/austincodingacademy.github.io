          Austin Coding Academy uses state of the art, remote technology to allow
          students from anywhere in the world to experience class as if they 
          were present in person. In addition to live lectures, Q&amp;Aâ€™s and
          project support, our remote students can attend remote office hours
          to receive one-on-one tutoring. They can interact with other
          students, and the instructor can even take over
          their computer to help them out of a jam. ACA Remote is a great option for
          someone who does not live in Austin.
