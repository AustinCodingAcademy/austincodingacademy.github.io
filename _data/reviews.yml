    "I just completed the entire Full Stack curriculum at Austin
    Coding Academy and not only did they help me transition my
    career into coding, they helped me land a JavaScript Engineering
    job before I even graduated. The instructors are 'wicked smart',
    the curriculum is challenging in a good way, and the community
    is incredibly supportive. I recommend anyone looking to upgrade
    their skill set or a complete career change to look no further
    than ACA for the most affordable and flexible option available."

    "I was reluctant to attend an immersive course but I wasn't making
    much progress on my own. I found ACA's flexible option and decided to take the
    leap. I can honestly say that it was the best investment I've made. From the
    very beginning, what set ACA apart (and what made me stay) is their open door
    policy and attention to each student. They are always looking for ways to
    improve the school based on feedback from the students. They are also building
    an amazing community full of inspiring and supportive people. I have made
    friends, gained confidence and found a sweet job thanks to ACA."

    "Challenging classes lead by an incredible team! As a (previously)
    non-technical person it was very very rewarding to learn coding in a way that
    suited my schedule and pace of learning. The structure and pace of their
    classes are great and enable you to really choose how and what you'd like to
    learn. The ACA team is comprised of professionals full of great resources for
    students to take advantage of. Highly recommend for those wanting to up their
    skill set or change careers all together."

    "Austin Coding Academy was a phenomenal experience for me. I had a
    little experience in web design and coding, so I knew I would enjoy it, but
    classes at ACA really pushed that passion forward. Instructors and staff are
    really driven and so obviously love what they do – they all go the extra mile
    to make sure you are getting everything you can out of class. ACA really
    strives to make their environment community-oriented, which allowed me to
    learn from classmates and even make great friends! I'm astonished at the
    amount of knowledge I gained in three short months and would recommend ACA to
    anyone I know."

    "The Intro course was a great kickstarter for my education in Coding.
    I wouldn't have been able to motivate myself without the help of the amazing
    teachers and staff of ACA. Everyone down to the owners are very involved in
    your education and are more than willing to help you understand anything you
    may be struggling with."

    "The people who run it are awesome and are very motivated to help
    people learn, hence the low prices. I loved the front-end beginner class
    (HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript). I had no prior experience with front-end or
    coding at all, and am now building websites on my own and making a great
    income from freelance work full-time. It required a lot of learning outside of
    class and working on things every day is crucial. I loved the productive
    environment and the teachers are very knowledgable. ACA gave me the right
    amount of structure, answered all of my questions, and set up a good
    foundation."

    "I love Austin Coding Academy and can not say enough good things
    about them! ACA not only teaches you Full-Stack Web Development, but also
    provides you with crucial skills to aide you in finding a job upon (or even
    before) graduation. Everyone involved with this school is passionate about
    learning and is completely invested in helping all the students succeed. I was
    able to build a fantastic network of people not only from the teachers, but
    from other students as well. Hands down, there is not another coding bootcamp
    out there where you get this much bang for your buck."

    "I come from a Finance background and I have never worked in IT
    before. In the past I have always had problems learning how to code but ACA
    helped me connect the dots. I researched many schools in the Austin area
    before choosing the Austin Coding Academy. The reason I chose them was because
    they offered the best quality at an exceptional price. Choosing to attend the
    Austin Coding Academy has proven to be one of the best decisions I have ever
    made."

    "My classmates are amazing. I've never been surrounded by such
    serious and determined students. Their hunger and determination servers as
    great motivation to study and study often. The course work and cirriculum are
    demanding, but never overwhelming and someone is always available to point you
    in the right direction. I have completed both the intro and intermediate
    course at Austin Coding Academy (Austin Campus) and it has been one of the
    best decisions I have ever made. They truly care about what their students
    learn and are always there to listen and provide support."
