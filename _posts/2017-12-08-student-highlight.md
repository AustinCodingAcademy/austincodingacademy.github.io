# Every week we like to feature one of our outstanding students at Austin Coding Academy. ACA’s student body is as diverse as it is interesting and we’d like to give ya’ll the opportunity to get to know them a little better. Our students make Austin Coding Academy the great place that it is.

## This week we’re putting the spotlight on Jon Thibeult! Jon was a professional developer before he came to us to further develop his knowledge. We asked Jon about himself and he has some interesting things to share!

### *What is your Hometown?*

#### I'm from Houston. Go Stros!


### *What do you do for work now?*

#### I'm an IT Application Developer for DXC Technology. I maintain and develop code for supply chain apps that link our business users with suppliers. 


### *What sparked your interested in coding?*

#### I graduated from college with a degree in Electrical Engineering. My Senior year project was to build remote controlled robots that play football, and I worked on the code for the microcontroller. I quickly realized this was way more fun and rewarding to me than what I was doing before. I think the biggest difference for me was that in EE you're working with concepts and ideas you can't physically see and need either a good imagination or expensive machines, while with software you can write code on your laptop in your dorm room and see the results instantly. So when I graduated I started a career in software instead, and haven't looked back since!


### *With your background, you were able to attend only our advanced javascript class. Can you tell us how this has or will help you in the future?*

#### Working with React and Node was like a breath of fresh air. I was amazed at how easy I could build powerful modern apps, and all the while I found it very intuitive and just plain fun to work with. Most of my work applications are using Java with older frameworks, and the difference is night and day. And with the industry giants moving towards an "everything Javascript" mindset, JS is exploding at the moment and I feel being proficient in it will be a huge help for me in my future career. 
 
 
### *Whats your favorite part of being a professional developer?*

#### Being able to create things that people use to make their work easier. It's a really cool feeling when thousands of employees and suppliers are using something that you worked on. 


### *Where is your favorite place to code*
 
#### My living room at home. Now that fellow ACA student Hal Peters doesn't live with me anymore, my couch is a nice quiet area to Netflix and code. (jk Hal). 


### *Do you have any unique skills or experiences?*

#### I'm a brown belt in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. Think UFC without any punches or strikes while wearing pajamas. 


### *If you're not working or coding what are you likely doing?*

#### When I'm not working or coding I'm usually rolling around with sweaty dudes (and gals!) on a mat somewhere, watching football and cursing at my fantasy team, or spending all my money and adding to my Hawaiian shirt collection. 
 

### *I've heard that you've been given a nickname or two. Care to elaborate?* 

#### Man, I'm not sure what it is about me, but everytime I go to a new BJJ gym I get a new nickname. At my first gym ever they called me "Rudy" because I went to school at Notre Dame. My first day at another BJJ school, one of the instructors said I look like the type of guy that would be a Bowflex model, and that name has really stuck with me ever since. Most recently my instructor gave me and another the nickname "Smash Bro", but I consider myself lucky to be a part of the duo given that the other half is a Jiu Jitsu rock star and is way better looking than me. 


### *Lastly, you're out with friends, what's your go-to drink?*

#### Rumple Minze. No one likes bad breath.
