    "I really needed something that could work with my life as it is now. I have
    a full time job and I have two kids and I really wasn't in a position to
    quit work and just focus on school 100%, so I needed something that would
    work with my existing schedule."

    "I remember coding when I was younger and it really struck a chord with me,
    so I decided to jump in and see if I could do anything more with it. It
    feels like a group of people trying to help you learn, not a school.
    It's just so hands-on."

    "I've seen curriculums from a lot of schools, and I think this one is the best.
    The team is really passionate. They love teaching, they love education,
    they love technology. It's the perfect mix of everything."

    "I chose to come here for three reasons: the flexibility that it offered my
    schedule, the price was just the most affordable option I found out there,
    and because I feel like the curriculum is so digestible for anyone to learn."
