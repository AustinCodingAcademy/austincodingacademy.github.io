      Austin Coding Academy does an amazing educating students! This is a great school that puts students first. All instructors are professional developers and learning from their experience is tremendously useful. This school requires a lot of work, so I wouldn't recommend it unless you're dedicated to working hard and really want to become a developer.

      I love this school! ACA is a great school with excellent instructors who not only know what they're doing - they're extremely helpful and always ready to assist you. I highly recommend this school to anyone interested in the field.

      I have had great life changing opportunities because of ACA! The entire staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. In the past I have always had problems learning how to code but ACA helped me connect the dots. I feel confident because they have taught me everything I need to know in order to be attractive to employers. I researched many schools in the Austin area before choosing the Austin Coding Academy. The reason I chose them was because they offered the best quality at an exceptional price. I come from a Finance background and I have never worked in IT before. The intro course is very informative and detailed. As soon as you begin classes the school brings in guest speakers and IT recruiters. I love the field trips we take as well. Halfway thru my Intro course the career services team placed me in a new job within the IT industry. It occurred very fast and I am very grateful for all their instruction and help. My goal is to have a better work-life balance and the Austin Coding Academy has already helped me get my foot in the door. I am very excited to see what opportunities will be presented to me once I complete the entire Full Stack Developer program. Choosing to attend the Austin Coding Academy has proven to be one of the best decisions I have ever made. The location of the campus is in Capital Factory so everyday I have the opportunity to network and learn from Tech giants. Also the view is incredible with the State Capital in the background(so cool)

      Austin Coding Academy will help you to succeed. I love Austin Coding Academy and can not say enough good things about them! ACA not only teaches you Full-Stack Web Development, but also provides you with crucial skills to aide you in finding a job upon (or even before) graduation. During my time there, ACA offered field trips to hot tech companies in Austin actively hiring, networking events, job fairs, and resume and interview workshops. Not only did I learn skills like whiteboarding and how to interview for a tech job, but I gained confidence in my own abilities that I would not have had otherwise. One of the owners actually personally helped me craft my resume in the middle of SXSW. Because of all this, I was able to land a job as Systems Engineer before I had even completed the final course. Everyone involved with this school is passionate about learning and is completely invested in helping all the students succeed. I was able to build a fantastic network of people not only from the teachers, but from other students as well. Hands down, there is not another coding bootcamp out there where you get this much bang for your buck.

      The instructors at ACA are very knowledgeable and truly enjoy teaching. 10/10, Would recommend to anyone in the Austin area wanting to get into coding. I went into the course knowing very little about coding, and after only the introductory course, I was already applying to jobs in the tech industry.

      I have completed both the intro and intermediate course at Austin Coding Academy (Austin Campus) and it has been one of the best decisions I have ever made. In 20 weeks I have gone from knowing some VERY limited HTML( I knew what a few tags were) to being able to design an interactive, good looking, web page with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I understand the fundamentals of computer programming and have developed a passion for learning multiple languages and getting deeper and deeper into the subject matter. I have already had two interviews for developer positions even though I have yet to complete the entire curriculum. While I was not accepted for these positions, I never would have had the opportunity to interview were it not for
      1. The skills aquired during my time at ACA and
      2. The AMAZING job network and support provided by ACA.
      They truly care about what their students learn and are always there to listen and provide support. My classmates are amazing. I've never been surrounded by such serious and determined students. Their hunger and determination servers as great motivation to study and study often. The course work and cirriculum are demanding, but never overwhelming and someone is always available to point you in the right direction. The administration at ACA are so incredbly helpful and are always open to feedback. I highly recommend Austin Coding Academy to anyone and everyone interested in coding and beyond. I can't wait to start the Advanced course.

      I came in to Austin Coding Academy's course with a feeling that the things I had been learning on my own were missing some large fundamentals and I was right. Austin Coding Academy helped me understand every step of the process for making a website not just the coding language. Luke and Chris, the founders, go above and beyond for the students and alumni by offering more than just qualified teachers. Students are given every chance to succeed with office hours, study groups and one-on-one tutoring if needed. The teachers who have years of experience in the industry, will challenge you with problems that will make you a better coder, improve your google-fu and stretch your knowledge base. The school is dedicated to not only with providing you in-depth knowledge, but also by helping you out on your future career path. Many students continue to be involved with the school after graduating going to alumni events, mentoring, and going to office hours. I am proud to stay that I got my first job in the web development industry as a Web Applications Developer because of Austin Coding Academy.

      Austin Coding Academy is one of the best decisions I have ever made. I just completed the intro course, and I can confidently say that the intro course alone had a direct impact on my ability to secure a new, higher paying job that I love! Yes, there are 5 coding boot camps in Austin right now. Let me tell you what sets this program apart:
      1. The Staff - The leadership and instructors at this school genuinely care deeply about 2 things. First, they care about you. They want you to succeed. They want you to make more money. They want you to take care of your family. And they do their best to make that happen through curriculum, project-based teaching, and networking. Second, they care about creating a workforce of people who can code well and contribute to the world.
      2. They are affordable. Do the research yourself and compare, and these guys will still come out on top.
      3. Last but not least, not only is the program designed for people who work full time, it is also broken into 3 10-week sessions. Maybe you're not sure if this is what you want to do for a living. Maybe you want to try out the first course and see how you do. You can do that here because you aren't forced into a long-term and expensive commitment.
      No matter what your education level may be (I never finished my Bachelor's degree), you can do this! I am planning on continuing this education, and you should plan on beginning i

      Austin Coding Academy has been one of the best educational experiences I've ever had. All the instructors were not only helpful and patient, but they were also engaging, inspiring and just plain FUN. I have no doubts that if I reached out to any of them now, they would be there with a helping hand. You're a fool not to want to learn at a place like ACA :))

      Guillermo Hernandez -
      The team here wants you to succeed. They offer hours outside of class time and have several TAs offering their time to help you out with projects. I'm self taught but only now have I learned Test Driven Development, Pair Programming, and Whiteboarding. These are crucial skills that employers expect. If you put in the work, ACA will teach you the skills to be a capable developer

      This school is a unique and special place. That kind of stuff seems maybe contrived or schmaltzy today, but it's true, and I know first hand.

      I decided to learn to code so I could improve my financial station, learn something cool, and possibly work from home to be hands on with my kids, and after a family recommendation , I decided on Code Academy. I had taken some frankly horrid Udemy classes, and read a few basic books, but I still really knew next to nothing whatsoever. Lots of pre-course work later, I felt prepared with enough basic knowledge to tackle the class.

      Everyone was very nice and professional, and when I was really struggling, the head of the place, Chris Lofton, addressed all of my concerns with real care and empathy, and assured me they would be there to support me, and help me succeed, and he really meant it. This place actually cares that you are learning something. It doesn't do them any good to take people's money and not produce graduates that can code, and they take to heart each person's situation, and as long as you reach out and communicate your issues, you WILL be helped. There were weekend labs with GREAT tutors like Victoria and Eddie, and by the end I was able to do things I never thought I could when we began.

      I am going back to take the intermediate track soon, and I look forward to becoming a Full Stack developer, as well as developing the relationships I am forming at the school.

      Code Academy is well worth your time and money. I was not one of the best students in the class, and if I can succeed and improve, surely anyone can. In two months you will go from barely being able to upload the word Hello to a web page, to creating fully responsive Bootstrap sites, and you will have HTML and CSS down cold. You must put the work in, but if you do, you will succeed, because you will be surrounded by talented, available people to assist you as you grow.

      Austin Coding Academy changed my life.  They taught me how to train my mind to think like a coder.  Front End and Back End development, everything you need to follow a digital career.  Right in the middle of the tech community in downtown Austin.  I am now a certified Full-Stack coder with unlimited potential.  ACA made it easy to accommodate to my schedule so I wouldn't have to give up my day job, and it worked. If you're considering coding, look no further!
