### **Helping the world by learning how to code**


Bartender turned Web Developer, Eddie Garcia is changing the Austin techscape. A part time mixologist and full time entrepreneur, he graduated Austin Coding Academy with flying colors!

Born and raised here in Austin, Eddie is a family-centric guy, and passionate entrepreneur. Along with his girlfriend and best friends, he's a founder of web design and strategy company Moonlight Grammar Interactive. He's also one of the instructors at ACA, and he's enthusiastic about helping his students to learn in an encouraging, supportive environment.

Eddie is continually learning and exploring - he loves creating in the kitchen, playing disc golf, and finding Austin's hidden gems. He's passionate about his city, advocating support for local businesses. 'It's long been a tenet of the Austin community, and I vote with my dollars every day. I encourage everyone else to do the same. Helping our neighbors is always good'.



### **How it all began: a desire for growth**


After working at a loading dock after high school, he very quickly realized he needed to continue his education. 'I realized a small school was for me', he explains. Attending Sul Ross State in Alpine for three years, ('Go Lobos!, he adds enthusiastically), he was unable to graduate when a family emergency unexpectedly brought him back to Austin - something he still regrets.



He waited tables through school, and worked in a bar upon his return. 'I got good, and then I got better,' he grins, as he explains his journey from door guy, to bartender and finally manager. 'It was a singular experience I would never give up,' he says with a wistful smile. He worked at some of Austin's most prestigious bars, describing his workmates as 'the most amazing people I've ever met - creative, diligent, inexhaustible.'



### **Changing the game: Learn to Code To Become An Entrepreneur.**


After ten years in the bar scene, cogs started ticking and - always eager to expand his repertoire - Eddie caught the startup bug. 'I'd learned so much about drinks, and people, and business. My girlfriend and I began a bar and beverage consulting business, and then another lightbulb went off. I needed more revenue and, since I was burned out on bartending for the moment, I needed more education'.



He heard about Austin Coding Academy on the radio. Coding seemed to be the best fit for his goals - a career change, financial independence, and much needed technological savvy. Technology has always fascinated Eddie. 'I'm an idea man who likes to make things,' he says. 'I was not at all good with computers. They baffled me'.

'The hours and curriculum sounded almost too good to be true,' he says, reflectively. 'I could learn to code and still give my bar business the attention it needed'. Coding allows creation without a lot of overhead - important for a small business owner like Eddie. 'No other medium lets you get so good, so quickly, and so affordably.'

He enrolled in the introductory class and quickly became hooked. 'I've never been a 'computer guy'', Eddie jokes. Nevertheless, he rose to the challenge, graduating ACA's full program. 'I can build an app', he says. 'That's a powerful sentence for me. I never thought I would be able to say that'. Learning to use new technology can be daunting, but when Eddie thinks about all the times he's finally understood some difficult concept, or fixed a seemingly impossible bug, his face shines with pride.



### **Helping others: coding for change**


Coding is not just another outlet for creativity for Eddie Garcia. Always the philanthropist, he explains how coding has helped him change not only his life, but the lives of local entrepreneurs. 'Getting a call from a local business owner who wants to thank me for helping them see possibilities, or reinvigorating them with new ideas, is one of the best feelings there is'.



Developers may have a stereotype for antisocial behavior - but Eddie is breaking that mold. 'Coding allows me to work with great people,' he points out. It's the brilliance, passion and compassion of the people he meets and befriends that make him feel so lucky to be a Freelance Web Developer. 'It's amazing,' he says with a smile.

For Eddie, learn how to code has opened up another avenue for him to help others - he's now teaching code to ACA students, who are eager to learn. 'Listening and helping in small ways has become a highlight in my life. I was very lucky. I was blessed with the most patient people in the world, who helped me learn. I just want others to share that joy.'

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Did learning how to code change the way Eddie thinks? Absolutely - ‘I see opportunities everywhere,' he says. ‘I don't watch a lot of tv anymore, I read business books. I get so caught up helping a project grow. I talk to people about their lives more.' For Eddie Garcia, coding isn't just a skill - it's helping him to become a better human being.
