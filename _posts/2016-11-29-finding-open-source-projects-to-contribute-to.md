Whether you're looking for extra programming practice or you're in the mood to volunteer, contributing to open source projects is certainly a worthy endeavor!

A common barrier to entry for developers wishing to participate in the open source community is simply the question "What project should I contribute to?"



### **How To Boost Your Credibility As a New Developer: Contribute to Open Source Projects**

Here is an extremely quick tip for finding a plethora of projects both worthy of your time and likely to incorporate your pull requests.

### Finding a Project


We're going to use [Github's Search](https://github.com/search) to help us find an open source project to contribute to. We want the search to meet the following criteria:



- We want the project to be in our language of choice
- We want the project to have between 250 and 500 stars
- We want the project to have been recently updated



**RATIONALE BEHIND THE SEARCH CRITERIA**



A project that has between 250 and 500 stars generally exhibit the following characteristics:

- The project is relatively mature
- The project has a sizeable number of users
- The project has most likely received and addressed some issues
- The project contributer base is small enough to where you're likely to interact with the project author directly
- The number of pull requests the project receives is most likely low enough to where your pull requests won't be drowned out by the others



Picking a project that has recently been updated lets you know that the project is actively maintained, and any pull requests you author have a decent chance of at least being evaluated.



**PERFORMING THE SEARCH**

First, head to [Github's search page.](https://github.com/search)
Next, enter the special flag stars: 250..500 as the search query.
You can then select your language of choice, and filter by Recently Updated.Browse for a project that interests you, and check out any issues they have open. See if you can make a pull request resolving the issue, or perhaps make a recommendation of your own!

**INSTALLATION DOC IMPROVEMENTS**

As a newcomer to the project you have chosen to work on, you have a very special quality that can only be harnessed once - you are setting up the system from scratch with no context for the very first time.

Use this rare opportunity to determine if the installation docs need refinement. Perhaps a dependency not listed in the docs was required to complete the installation, for example. Documentation pull requests are always appreciated and nearly always accepted!

**UP FOR GRABS**

The website [up-for-grabs.net](http://up-for-grabs.net/#/) contains a curated list of projects on Github ready for newcomers to "Jump in". Project maintainers inform Up-for-grabs of issues available to newcomers by adding a "Jump in" label to the issue on Github.
