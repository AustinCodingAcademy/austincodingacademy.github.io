### Why All Designers Should Learn To Code










Here at Austin Coding Academy we think our Alumni are rock stars and we want the whole world to know it! They are diving in head first to become badass coders, and taking on the challenge to change their lives. Gizem Yilmaz, a recent graduate, is no exception.

Working at a Graphic Designer, Gizem was burnt out and struggling to reignite the spark she once had for her career. When she found herself unexpectedly laid off, she began searching for a new job but quickly realized she had lost her competitive edge. Gizem refused to give up; instead, she began focusing on her Web Design skills. She also added some basic coding into the mix. 'I spent every waking hour devouring tutorials, books and blogs about web design,' she explains.

Her hard work and dedication paid off. Not only did she land a new job, she also set herself on a new career track as a Web Designer.

As her new job required more coding, she felt out of her depth. 'I was breaking the website!' she recalls and 'Meanwhile, I was trying to learn Ruby and JavaScript on my own but not really understanding it. That's when I realized I was willing to put in the time but needed some help'.







### 'It took me a long time to understand that just because I am self-taught doesn't mean I have to learn alone.'




Searching for a coding school, Gizem considered everything from online programs to full-time courses. Unfortunately, none seemed like the right fit. 'With the former, I was reluctant to spend my money on any online source no matter how good the reviews were. With the latter, I realized that I wasn't willing to completely abandon my design career to be a developer, especially when I wasn't sure if I would love coding or even be good at it!' she laughs.



Gizem finally heard about Austin Coding Academy from a coworker. She realized that a part-time html/css and javascript class would fit in perfectly with her job and lifestyle. She quickly signed up – and the rest is history!

A graduate of ACA's classes, she emphasizes the importance of being able to code and design.

Speaking from experience, she believes many designers with limited or no coding skills 'end up with a mediocre version of their designs based on their limited skills, or they depend too much on a developer to complete projects.' When it comes to using templates or plugins, 'things start looking cookie cutter, and a pretty template doesn't always fit your content needs or provide good UI/UX.' She also stresses that 'you may not be aware of best practices and do things the wrong way which causes problems down the line.'



### The worst thing a designer can do is 'become stagnant and replaceable'.





It's an ongoing debate – should designers have coding skills? 'Design is such a saturated career path,' she declares. 'Even if you don't become a full-on developer, I guarantee that learning to code will give you a competitive edge – especially in terms of salary. One thing I would really like to highlight is that HTML and CSS, [as well as] some familiarity with JavaScript and jQuery are required by many jobs and crucial to success in the current job market.'

Gizem is now working as a platform UX/UI designer at [Continuum Analytics](https://www.continuum.io/). She is loving the challenges and rewards of her new role. She credits her newfound coding skills.
