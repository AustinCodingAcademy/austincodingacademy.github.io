<span style="font-weight: 400;">Founders of Austin Coding Academy Luke Filipos and Chris Sica met during college, and have been practically inseparable ever since.

Luke hails from Portland, Maine. A child of entrepreneurs, he always wanted to run his own company. He's a traveller, with thirty-two countries under his belt. He's a great cook, happily entertaining large groups of people, and working off his overindulgences with Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.

Chris grew up in the Virgin Islands where his parents owned a bar called 'Skinny Legs'. Opting to attend university in the United States, he headed to Richmond to study biochemistry, and met Luke.

After college, they worked together for a sales training company in Nashville for six years. Wanting to start companies of their own, they moved to New York City. Chris joined a startup, while Luke travelled aboard a cruise ship selling art, returning for another startup position. 'We got really tired of being cold and wet in the North East,' says Chris. Luke adds that 'when Hurricane Sandy hit, and tore the roof off our apartment, we took that as an opportunity to try running our own business on the road.' Never ones to say no to a challenge, and eager to travel, they packed up everything they owned into Chris' Honda Civic and drove cross country for almost a year, with intermittent trips to Europe.



**Packing up, and opening doors**

While on their journey, they met with universities and professors, and built a textbook wholesale company, undercutting their competition. It wasn't all business though - they visited national parks and stayed with friends, falling in love with Austin, but landing in Colorado Springs.

There, they hired students from the local university to build a web app, with plans for a used book marketplace. Unfortunately, despite their background in sales, the app failed. 'We were just the absolute worst project managers,' jokes Luke. Chris explains that 'at the time, Luke and I were both non-technical, so we weren't great at explaining what we needed and had no idea how it would work'.



**A lack of choices, and one great idea**

They returned to Austin - a city with a quirky personality and a quickly growing tech community. It was then that they realized the city had only one option for structured coding courses. Knowing they wouldn't do well learning on their own, they were faced with an intense, three month long, full-time bootcamp with a hefty price tag of $16K.

Irritated at the lack of middle-ground, 'we realized that there were probably other folks in a similar situation,' Chris says. He explains that while there are countless online resources, for people who want to learn the basics it's incredibly hard to find an efficient path.

Realizing Austin was poised to become the next tech hub - and potentially the next San Francisco - Luke and Chris decided to form their own school.



**Teaching, and learning, and learning to teach**

The curriculum was written by developer friends who agreed to teach part-time. Also experienced instructors, they have experience working for Teach for America, KIPP, the UT Charter System, and a local college. Luke and Chris handle the business operations and marketing. 'We felt confident in running a training program, since we did that [before, in Nashville],' says Luke.

'Initially we just wanted a comfortable place where people (including us) could learn to code without having to spend a ton of money,' Luke explains. 'That's still the heart what we do, but it's grown into being a mission of helping non-technical people transition into technical careers.'



**Practical classes for part time learners**

The first class is designed for beginners, teaching them the infrastructure of the web while building websites in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery, and a bit of Javascript. Soon after completing the first semester, they realized their students were hooked, and the intermediate and advanced classes were soon introduced.

This extended program provides an opportunities to jump into a development career. The part-time classes are a perfect fit for students with busy lives, full time jobs, families and other commitments. After two years, ACA has built an excellent curriculum and a personalised approach to teaching.

Luke explains this methodology. 'Our classes are designed to be very practical, and we've cut a lot of the fat from traditional educational institutions. Students are building projects and learning skills that are directly applicable to a wide area of jobs in the tech industry. We're very much "teaching a man to fish" so to speak, by giving students the tools to build powerful web programs and sites; things that are valuable and useable.'



**Building more than just a school**

The school's mission statement is to provide affordable, accessible coding education. Working with true beginners and taking them from zero to job ready over nine months is an extremely rewarding experience. Luke, Chris and the teaching staff are proud to watch their students succeed. With 80% of graduates being successfully employed, Luke and Chris are delighted.

'We've seen coding be a truly game changing skill for helping people break into the middle class and really positively change their lives,' Luke declares. 'Our current big milestone is to help 100,000 people get into tech jobs. Once we hit that number we'll see where we go from there. For now we're focusing on building out really incredible curriculum and learning experiences to facilitate that goal.'



**Spreading the coding love**

The school is expanding - with campuses in Austin, San Antonio, Dallas and Houston - and they're hoping to grow further while maintaining their standards of quality for instruction and mentorship. 'The most rewarding part of my job,' says Luke, 'is seeing the school [become] a fluidly functioning place where people can comfortably learn to code and do it without having to mortgage their future.'

Luke and Chris are also working on developing an online version of their classes, but won't be releasing it until they can replicate the same level of encouragement, challenge and guidance the instructors are able to offer in person.

Accessibility is their focus - part time night classes, instructors available online to answer questions, tutoring labs on the weekend, and a practical approach to learning.

Austin Coding Academy's graduates are career ready, and ready to take the tech industry by storm.

'Coding is a very rewarding career if approached properly,' Chris smiles. 'On top of the earning potential, you will continue to learn and grow and push yourself, continue to be creative and be able to solve problems and turn ideas into real things. It is an incredible craft.'
