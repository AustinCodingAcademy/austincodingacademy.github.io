      classroom space costs down and developers who want to give back to keep
      instruction costs down. This allows us to provide the most powerful coding
      education in Texas at the lowest price out there.

  - question: What happens when I complete a course?
    answer: >
      Two things: At the end of each course, students who completed the
      curriculum will receive a certificate showing they passed the course and
      detailing that level of proficiency; additionally, we have an exit
      consultation with each and every student to help them figure out the next
      step, whether that is moving forward on a track with us, continuing their
      education on their own, launching a project, or finding employment. We're
      here to help!

  - question: Do I have to take the Intro course to get into the Intermediate etc?
    answer: >
      Students with a pre-qualified level of proficiency can test into the
      intermediate and advanced courses.

  - question: Do I have to take each course immediately after?
    answer: >
      Students can take classes at their own pace, however we do encourage
      taking classes consecutively one after the other, as the continuity in
      education and practice is paramount; as with learning a spoken language,
      if you don't use it you lose it.

  - question: What is the schedule of classes?
    answer: >
      Each course (Intro, Intermediate, Advanced) is 10 weeks long and
      meets twice a week in the evenings, from 6:30-9:00 pm. Depending on the
      class you're taking you would meet either Monday and Wednesday or Tuesday
      and Thursday. We run on a quarter system and have four sessions each year.

  - question: What kind of computer do I need?
    answer: >
      Just about any Mac or Windows laptop built within the last five or
      six years will do. If you have a choice, we recommend a Mac, but there's no
      need to buy a mac if you have a functional Windows machine. We do discourage
      Chromebooks and Tablets.
